# Italo Svevo - Intro to machine learning project 
This repository attempts to answer the following problem:

A corpus of approximately 900 letters sent by and received to Italo Svevo, the famous writer from Trieste, is publicly available. 
The letters are written in different languages (Italian, English, German, and Triestino, the dialect of Trieste); sometimes, more than one language is used in the same letter.

The goal is to discover and report:

- which are the main topics of discussion in the corpus, who are the persons which each topic is more associated with, how does the interest on different topics evolve over the time
- which are the sentiments (positive, negative, at least) expressed in the letters, how are they related with persons and topics, how do they evolve over the time

The corpus contains info about: corpus section name, index of letter in the section, date of the letter, year of the letter, sender of the letter, location of the sender, recipient, location of the recipient, languages used in the letter, main language, text of the letter.
